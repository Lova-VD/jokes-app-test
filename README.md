# Joke Service for admin

`POST /api/jokes`: End point to create a Joke
`GET /api/jokes`: End point to get all jokes
`GET /api/jokes/{id}`: End point to get a joke by ID
`PUT/PATCH /api/jokes/{id}`: End point to update a joke by ID

Note: I have used `Docker` and `Kubernetes` for the project. So to run this on your machine please change the docker image to your local image.

I have used a Micro Service Architecture for the test project.
